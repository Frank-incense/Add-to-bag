# Add to Bag Card

This is a simple and responsive Add to Bag Card built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my front-end development skills, including UI design, styling, and dynamic interactions using JavaScript.

## Features

âœ… Responsive Design â€“ Ensures compatibility across different screen sizes.

âœ… Minimalist & Clean Layout â€“ Styled with modern CSS techniques.

âœ… Interactive UI â€“ Users can click the Add to Bag button to see real-time feedback.

âœ… JavaScript Functionality â€“ Button text changes dynamically to indicate when an item is added.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 â€“ For structuring the card.

- CSS3 â€“ For styling and layout.

- JavaScript (ES6+) â€“ For interactive UI elements.

## How It Works

1. Users see a product card with an Add to Bag button.

2. Clicking the button updates the text to show the item has been added.

3. The button disables or changes appearance to prevent duplicate clicks.

4. JavaScript handles the interaction logic.

## Screenshots

(Add relevant screenshots or a GIF here to showcase the design and interaction)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/add-to-bag-card.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the card in action.

## Future Improvements

- Store bag items using local storage.

- Implement a shopping cart page.

- Enhance UI with smooth animations.
